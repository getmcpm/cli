# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `mcpm outdated` — detect version drift and trust regression across installed servers. Shows which servers have newer releases and flags servers whose trust score has degraded since install.
- Encrypted secrets store (`mcpm secrets`) — store MCP server credentials locally using AES-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation. Zero native dependencies; uses Node.js built-in `crypto.subtle`.
- `mcpm publish` — scaffold, validate, and submit MCP server packages to the registry. Includes a 5-step interactive wizard (`mcpm publish scaffold`), a pre-flight trust gate (`mcpm publish check`), and submission (`mcpm publish`).
- ServersFile schema v2 — servers file now uses `{ mcpmSchemaVersion: 2, servers: [...] }` format with backward-compatible migration from the legacy bare-array format.

### Removed
- Telemetry infrastructure removed — aligns with the documented "No telemetry. No analytics. No account required." guarantee.

## [0.3.3] - 2025-01-01
