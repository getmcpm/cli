# TODOS

## Resolved Blockers

### 1. ~~Verify Official MCP Registry API~~ DONE (2026-03-28)
**Resolution:** API verified. Use **v0.1** (not v0). Key findings:
- Search param is `search` (not `q`), substring match on name only
- No full-text search — need client-side description filtering
- `environmentVariables` is inside `packages[]`, not top-level
- Pagination: `cursor` + `limit` (max 100), `metadata.nextCursor`
- `packages[]` confirmed: `registryType` = `npm | pypi | oci`
- `_meta` has `status`, `publishedAt`, `updatedAt`, `isLatest`

### 2. ~~Resolve npm Package Name~~ DONE (2026-03-28)
**Resolution:** npm package name = `@getmcpm/cli`, bin command = `mcpm`.
- `mcpm` taken (Minecraft Package Manager)
- `mcpx`, `mcp-pm`, `mcp-registry`, `mcpman` all taken
- `@getmcpm/cli` is available and follows `{tool}-cli` convention

## Pre-launch

### 3. ~~Config Backup-Before-Write~~ DONE (2026-04-06)
**Resolution:** Implemented in BaseAdapter.writeAtomic (base.ts:49). Writes .bak file before every atomic write. mcpm up takes a single .bak snapshot before batch starts (up.ts:223).

### 4. ~~Cross-Platform Config Paths~~ DONE (2026-04-06)
**Resolution:** All three platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows) handled in config/paths.ts.
Claude Desktop + VS Code use `appDataDir()` which resolves to `~/Library/Application Support` (macOS), `~/.config` (Linux), `%APPDATA%` (Windows).
Cursor and Windsurf are home-relative on ALL platforms (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`) — they do NOT use APPDATA on Windows. Previous code incorrectly routed them through APPDATA on Windows; fixed.

## Security (from CSO audit 2026-03-29)

### 5. ~~Pin GitHub Actions to SHA hashes~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** All actions in ci.yml and publish.yml pinned to full SHA hashes with `# v4` comments.

### 6. ~~Add CODEOWNERS for workflow files~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Created `.github/CODEOWNERS` requiring `@getmcpm/maintainers` review for `.github/workflows/` changes. Note: branch protection rules must be enabled in GitHub settings for enforcement.

### 7. ~~Set chmod 600 on config files containing secrets~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Added `mode: 0o600` to writeFile and `mode: 0o700` to mkdir in BaseAdapter.writeAtomic and store/index.ts.

### 8. ~~Add timeout to external scanner subprocess~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Added `timeout: 30_000` to execFileAsync in tier2.ts defaultExec.

### 9. ~~Switch validateRuntimeArgs from blocklist to allowlist~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Replaced dangerous-flag blocklist with SAFE_ARG_PATTERNS allowlist. Only known-safe patterns (--port, --host, --transport, --verbose, etc.) are permitted. All unknown flags including --loader, --experimental-loader are now rejected.

### 10. ~~Apply NFKC normalization before scanner pattern matching~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Added `text.normalize("NFKC")` to detectSecrets and detectPromptInjection. Extended zero-width char detection to cover `\u202A-\u202F\u2028\u2029`.

### 11. ~~Scan server.title, remote headers, and runtimeArgs for injection~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Extended scanTier1 to scan server.title, remote header descriptions, and package runtimeArguments for prompt injection.

### 12. ~~Cap registryMeta trust score when critical findings present~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Added `hasCriticalOrHighFindings()` check in computeTrustScore. registryMeta bonus is zeroed when critical or high severity findings are present.

### 13. ~~Tighten server name regex in tier2.ts~~ DONE (2026-03-30)
**Resolution:** Updated SERVER_NAME_RE to require alphanumeric chars at both start and end of each segment (no leading/trailing hyphens or dots).

## Post-V1

### 15. Encrypted Secret Storage for Stack Files
**Priority:** P2
**What:** Investigate alternatives to plaintext env var storage in client config files. Options: OS keychain integration, encrypted .env files, reference-only storage (pointer to secret manager).
**Why:** Stack files scale team-wide. Every `mcpm up` writes secrets as plaintext JSON to client configs. With 5+ servers each needing API keys, that's 5+ plaintext secrets per developer per IDE.
**Context:** Current approach (plaintext + chmod 600) is the npm/pip norm. But mcpm positions as a security tool. Plaintext secrets in 4 config files per machine is inconsistent with that positioning. Not blocking for V1.3 but matters for enterprise adoption.
**Depends on:** V1.3 stack files (shipped).

### 14. Optional Anonymous Telemetry
**Priority:** P2
**What:** Add opt-in anonymous telemetry (install count, command usage, error types).
**Why:** After V1 launch, you'll want to know adoption patterns. V1 skips this to avoid trust paradox ("security tool that tracks you").
**How:** Simple opt-in on first run. Anonymous counters only. No PII, no server names.
**Depends on:** V1 launch, established trust.

## v0.5.0 mcpm-guard — Deferred Security Findings

These came out of the security-reviewer agent's audit of the v0.5.0 guard subsystem (2026-05-16). Critical and high findings were fixed in commit; these are deferred with rationale.

### 16. Add tool_annotations signatures (security review F12)
**Priority:** P1 — v0.5.0.1
**What:** The pattern engine's `tool_annotations` target is wired (patterns.ts routes to `result.tools[*].annotations`) but no shipped signature uses it. Add an annotation-injection signature mapped to OWASP-MCP-1.
**Why:** Annotations are an MCP extension surface that tool-poisoning attacks specifically exploit (Invariant Labs disclosure). Custom annotation fields can carry injection text that bypasses description-only checks.
**Effort:** ~30 min (one signature entry + tests).

### 17. Credential-content detection in tool responses (security review F4)
**Priority:** P1 — v0.5.0.1
**What:** Add `tool_response` signatures matching PEM private keys, AWS credentials block, JWT tokens, etc. Current guard catches the path in tool_call_args (warn) but not the resulting key material in the response (no signature).
**Why:** Real exfil chain is: poisoned description → tool call with path (warned, forwarded) → server returns key contents in response (no signature fires). Closes the chain.
**Effort:** ~1 hr (3-5 signature entries + tests).

### 18. Base64 / URL-encoded payload decoding pass (security review F13)
**Priority:** P2 — v0.5.1
**What:** Preprocess string leaves: detect ≥20-char base64 / URL-encoded blobs, decode, re-run inspection on decoded content.
**Why:** Naive regex evasion. Attackers can base64-encode "ignore previous instructions" and slip past the engine.
**Effort:** ~2 hrs (decoder + recursion guard + tests).

### 19. Homoglyph normalization (Unicode TR39 skeleton) (security review F2 partial)
**Priority:** P2 — v0.5.1
**What:** NFKC + zero-width strip (done in v0.5.0) does NOT fold homoglyphs (Cyrillic `о` for Latin `o`, etc.). TR39 skeleton algorithm or a confusables library would close this gap.
**Why:** "ignоre previоus instructiоns" (Cyrillic 'о' substitutions) evades every shipped signature today.
**Effort:** ~3 hrs (vendor a confusables map, integrate into normalizeForMatch, add tests).

### 20. Direct test for ReadBuffer 64MB cap (security review F6 follow-up)
**Priority:** P2 — v0.5.1
**What:** The cap is implemented in `wireDirection`; tested only by inspection. Add a subprocess test that withholds the newline delimiter and verifies the relay closes the child + emits the DoS event.
**Effort:** ~30 min.

### 21. Document `tool_response` target scope precisely (security review F10)
**Priority:** P3 — docs
**What:** Add an inline comment in patterns.ts:targetSubtree explaining that `tool_response` matches any JSON-RPC `result.content`, regardless of which method prompted it. This is intentional (broader detection coverage) but should be documented so it's not "fixed" away.
**Effort:** ~5 min docs.

### 22. Track `fast-uri` CVE remediation (security review F3, Next Step 5 audit)
**Priority:** P1 — when upstream patches
**What:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0` pulls in `ajv` which depends on `fast-uri <= 3.1.1`. Two HIGH CVEs (GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6 path traversal, GHSA-v39h-62p7-jpjc host confusion) are unpatched in our locked version. Neither is directly exploitable in our usage (the SDK uses ajv for JSON-schema $id resolution on trusted MCP envelope shapes), but they show up in `pnpm audit`.
**How:** Monitor `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` releases for a version that bumps fast-uri to ≥3.1.2. If urgent, add a `pnpm overrides` entry to force `fast-uri@^3.1.2` once SDK compatibility is verified.
**Depends on:** Upstream SDK release.

### 23. Zod-validate McpServerEntry shape in BaseAdapter.read() (security review F8, Next Step 5 audit)
**Priority:** P2 — v0.5.1
**What:** `BaseAdapter.read()` does an unchecked cast: `servers as Record<string, McpServerEntry>`. A malformed config (e.g., `args: "bad"` instead of `args: ["bad"]`) silently corrupts the wrap transform (spreading a string produces single-character args). Validate each entry through a Zod schema before returning; skip-with-warning on malformed entries.
**Effort:** ~1 hr (schema + tests).

### 24. Single-atomic-write for pins.json + integrity (security F8, Step 6 audit)
**Priority:** P2 — v0.5.1
**What:** `writePins` currently does two atomic renames (pins.json then pins.json.integrity). A concurrent reader between the two sees new content + old hash and fires `PinsIntegrityError`. With Step 6's fail-closed F1 fix, that brief window blocks all traffic transiently. Reformat to a single file where the integrity hash is embedded as the first line, or retry once on read-side mismatch before raising.
**Effort:** ~1.5 hrs (refactor + tests for race).

### 25. Zod-validate PinsFile shape on read (security F10, Step 6 audit)
**Priority:** P2 — v0.5.1
**What:** `readPins` does `JSON.parse(content) as PinsFile`. A tampered or hand-corrupted pins.json with `current_hash: 42` slips past type-only validation and causes weird downstream behavior (always-drift or always-pass depending on shape). Add a Zod schema with strict hash regex (sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}) and reject malformed entries with a clear message.
**Effort:** ~45 min.

### 26. NFC normalize before hashing tool definitions (security F12, Step 6 audit)
**Priority:** P3 — v0.5.1
**What:** `hashToolDefinition` hashes raw bytes. Legitimate server upgrades that change Unicode normalization form (e.g., NFD → NFC, U+212B Angstrom → U+00C5 Å) produce different hashes and false-positive as drift. Apply `string.normalize("NFC")` to description strings before hashing. This is a breaking change to existing pins — bump PINS_FORMAT_VERSION and add a migration that re-pins on first read.
**Effort:** ~1 hr (incl. migration).

### 27. Buffer first-session tools/list until off-thread pin write commits (security F3 hardening)
**Priority:** P3 — v0.5.1
**What:** Step 6 closed F3 with a per-session in-memory "first hash seen" map, which catches double-tools/list in the same session. A stricter close is: don't forward the first tools/list response until the off-thread pin write completes (one round-trip delay; once-per-session-per-server). Higher latency but eliminates any same-session unprotected window.
**Effort:** ~2 hrs (refactor sync inspect → async with await on the off-thread).
